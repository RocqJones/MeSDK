- This is the base application that contains the launcher.

### 2. Design - Library
- Contains all UI Composable interfaces

### 3. Logic - Library
- On this shared module, all business and network logic, data structures, Utils, models, listeners go here, e.t.c

## CI/CD
- We laveraging the **GitHub Android CI** system that lets us automatically build and test our app every time we check in updates to our source code.
